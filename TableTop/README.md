# TableTop #

### Description ###

TableTop is a web application the main purpose of which is to make it easier to play board role-playing games (e.g. Dungeons & Dragons) over large distances. The application serves as a table top which can be accessed online and which players can interact with in different ways. I worked on this project in a team of four people. On the front-end we used HTML and CSS, on the backend we utilized Spring framework with Hibernate and all the applicationâ€™s data was stored in MySQL database. Although I contributed on various sides of the project, my primary responsibility was the front-end development of the web application.

### Installation ###

Clone the repo and import it into spring. Make sure you have maven, tomcat and MySQL set up with  your Spring IDE. MySql requires a user account with Username:root and Password:1995, it also requires a database called "elec5619" to be created . Then simply run the website from spring and go to http://localhost:8080/sydney/index in your web browser of choice.
