			<a id="ausobesity"><h2>Australia's Obesity Epidemic</h2></a>
			
			<p>The statistics says that men and women are much heavier than they were a quarter of a century ago, with two in three Australians considered to be overweight. <br><br>
“That’s a big problem because obesity leads to diabetes, some cancers and heart disease,” says Dr Rob Grenfell, National Director of Cardiovascular Health at the Heart Foundation.<br><br>
More than four million Australians are considered to be obese while half a million people are up to 40 kilograms above their ideal weight. <br><br>
The average Australian man now weighs 85.9 kilograms which is 6.5 kilograms more than the 1989 average. Whilst the average woman is 71.1 kilos which is 5.7kgs above the 1989 average.<br><br>
Dietician Karen Inge says people must take into account how small changes to a daily routine can affect their weight.  <br><br>
“Eating a little bit more, having that extra latte, not going for a walk – all these lifestyle changes and modifications make a difference to either gaining or losing weight.”<br><br>
It is believed that key to a healthy nation is cheaper healthy food.<br><br>
 “This is what government needs to look at - making healthy foods more affordable. Because in the long run, prevention is better than cure.”<br><br>
However, when it comes to healthy food, people often don’t know what they’re looking for, says Dr Grenfell.<br><br>
“At the moment, we have a whole heap of gobbledygook on packets. There’s organic, light, low salt, low fat. What does it all mean?”<br><br>
Experts say a lack of exercise and knowledge about healthy eating has led to the weight increase over the years.  </p>

			<a id="cardioweightloss"><h2>Cardio for Weight Loss</h2></a>
			<p>When the word “cardio” is mentioned, one may think of it as an evil tiring activity. As evil as it sounds and looks, giving cardio a chance is the right thing to do. When properly paired with weight training, a good cardio plan can lead you to an ideal world of fat loss and help you carve a great, shapely figure and eventually help one achieve their fat loss goal. <br><br>
			The trick is figuring out which cardiovascular exercises will put one on the fast path to meeting their goals.<em> Hint</em>: You can kiss mind-numbingly slow walks on the treadmill goodbye. It has been found that four effective movements that will be perfectly for a cardio routine.</p>
			
				<h6>The Stairmaster</h6><p>
				The stairmaster is one of the best cardio exercises for a number of reasons. Most importantly, it targets the glutes and thighs and it's guaranteed to make one sweat. 
				The stairmaster's also great for fat loss. In fact, if one gets into a really aggressive mindset, they can almost feel the fat melting off. The key is intensity. Don't treat time on the stepper as one would a typical jaunt on the treadmill or stroll in the park. Crank up the intensity a bit, and get to work.</p>
		
				<h6>Plyometrics 'Jumping Jack Attack'</h6>	<p>

				Plyometrics are on the opposite end of the spectrum from one’s standard, bored-to-tears cardio workout. Plyometrics are challenging: They get the heart pumping and require a go-getter's mentality.
				Plyometrics are also easily adaptable. If one is new to the movements, they can get away with fairly basic body-weight-only exercises like jumping jacks. They're convenient and portable, so no excuses.
				The trick is— doing as many jumping jacks in 20 seconds, then rest for 20 seconds. Here's the kicker: When you repeat the process, increase the time to 30 seconds and rest for 30 seconds. Then move on to 40 seconds. Repeat this cycle three times for a quick and effective cardio workout!</p>

		
				<h6>Running</h6>	<p>

				This may not be a glamorous choice, but running outdoors has always been a great cardiovascular exercise. Running is obviously a key cardiovascular exercise, but it has been found that it can be a great stress reliever, too. If one leads a busy lifestyle, a good run may be exactly what they need to relax. Put the headphones in, throw on some music, and start running towards the personal Zen zone.</p>

			
				<h6>Jumping Rope</h6><p>

				Incorporating a jump rope cardio session into the workout routine is a great idea, jumping for a prescribed number of jumps or amount of time between exercises. Doing 50-100 jumps or jump for 30-60 seconds between exercises. It's a fantastic way to keep the heart rate up while working out. An increased heart rate speeds up fat loss, keeps things interesting, and gives one a heck of a workout in the process.</p>

		<a id="weighttraining"><h2>Weightlifting for weight loss</h2></a>
		<h6>You'll lose 40 percent more fat</h6>
		<p>If you think cardio is the key to blasting belly fat, keep reading: When Penn State researchers put dieters into three groups—no exercise, aerobic exercise only, or aerobic exercise and weight training—they all lost around 21 pounds, but the lifters shed six more pounds of fat than those who didn't pump iron. Why? The lifters' loss was almost pure fat; the others lost fat and muscle.</p>

		<h6>Your Clothes will fit better</h6>
		<p>Research shows that between the ages of 30 and 50, you'll likely lose 10 percent of your body's total muscle. Worse yet, it's likely to be replaced by fat over time, says a study. And that increases your waist size, because one pound of fat takes up 18 percent more space than one pound of muscle.</p>

		<h6>You'll burn more calories</h6>
		<p>Lifting increases the number of calories you burn while your butt is parked on the couch. That's because after each strength workout, your muscles need energy to repair their fibers. In fact, researchers found that when people did a total-body workout with just three big-muscle moves, their metabolisms were raised for 39 hours afterward. They also burned a greater percentage of calories from fat compared with those who didn't lift.<br><br>
Lifting gives you a better burn during exercise too: Doing a circuit of eight moves (which takes about eight minutes) can expend 159 to 231 calories. That's about what you'd burn if you ran at a 10-mile-per-hour pace for the same duration.</p>

		<h6>Your Diet will improve</h6>
		<p>Exercise helps your brain stick to a diet plan. University of Pittsburgh researchers studied 169 overweight adults and found that those who didn't follow a three-hours-a-week training regimen ate more than their allotted 1,500 calories a day. The reverse was also true—sneaking snacks sabotaged their workouts. The study authors say both diet and exercise likely remind you to stay on track, aiding your weight-loss goals.</p>

		<h6>You'll handle stress better</h6>
		<p>Break a sweat in the weight room and you'll stay cool under pressure. Scientists determined that the fittest people exhibited lower levels of stress hormones than those who were the least fit. Another study found that after a stressful situation, the blood pressure levels of people with the most muscle returned to normal faster than the levels of those with the least muscle.</p>

		<h6>You'll be happier</h6>
		<p>Yoga isn't the only Zen-inducing kind of exercise. Researchers found that people who performed three weight workouts a week for six months significantly improved their scores on measures of anger and overall mood.</p>

		<h6>You'll Build Stronger Bones</h6>
		<p>As you age, bone mass goes to pot, which increases your likelihood of one day suffering a debilitating fracture. The good news: A study found that 16 weeks of resistance training increased hip bone density and elevated blood levels of osteocalcin, a marker of bone growth--by 19 percent.</p>

		<h6>You'll Get into shape faster</h6>
		<p>The term cardio shouldn't describe only aerobic exercise: A study found that circuit training with weights raises your heart rate 15 beats per minute higher than if you ran at 60 to 70 percent of your max heart rate. This approach strengthens muscles and provides cardiovascular benefits similar to those of aerobic exercise—so you save time without sacrificing results</p>

		<h6>Your Heart Will Be Healthier</h6>
		<p>Researchers at the University of Michigan found that people who did three total-body weight workouts a week for two months decreased their diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number) by an average of eight points. That's enough to reduce the risk of a stroke by 40 percent and the chance of a heart attack by 15 percent.</p>

		<h6>You'll Be Way More Productive</h6>
		<p>Lifting could result in a raise (or at least a pat on the back from your boss). Researchers found that workers were 15 percent more productive on days they exercised compared with days they didn't. So on days you work out, you can (theoretically) finish in eight hours what would normally take nine hours and 12 minutes. Or you'd still work for nine hours but get more done, leaving you feeling less stressed and happier with your job--another perk reported on days workers exercised.</p>

		<h6>You'll live longer</h6>
		<p>University of South Carolina researchers determined that total-body strength is linked to lower risks of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer. Similarly, other scientists found that being strong during middle age is associated with "exceptional survival," defined as living to the age of 85 without developing a major disease.</p>

		<h6>You'll be even smarter</h6>
		<p>Muscles strengthen your body and mind: Brazilian researchers found that six months of resistance training enhanced lifters' cognitive function. In fact, the sweat sessions resulted in better short- and long-term memory, improved verbal reasoning, and a longer attention span.</p>

		<a id="hydration"><h2>Why is it important to stay hydrated?</h2></a>
		<p>Whether one is a serious athlete or a weight lifter, it is vitally important to make sure one gets the right amount of water before, during and after exercising. Water regulates the body temperature, lubricates joints and helps transport nutrients for energy and health. If the body is not properly hydrated, one will be unable to perform at its highest level, and you may experience fatigue, muscle cramps, dizziness or more serious symptoms.</p>
		<h6>How much water should I be drinking?</h6><p>
There are no set guidelines for the intake of water while exercising because everyone’s body is different. Sweat rate, heat, humidity, exercise intensity and duration are just some of the factors that affect one’s water intake.</p>
		<p>The Australian Council on Fitness has suggested the following basic water intake guidelines for people doing moderate- to high-intensity exercise:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Drink 1 litre of water 2 to 3 hours before you start exercising</li>
				<li>Drink 300 mL of water 20 to 30 minutes before you start exercising or during your warm-up</li>
				<li>Drink 200 mL of water every 10 to 20 minutes during exercise</li>
				<li>Drink 250 mL of water no more than 30 minutes after you exercise</li>
			</ul>

		<p>If one does not get sufficient amounts of water they can suffer from dehydration</p>
		<h6>What are the signs of dehydration?</h6>
		<p>Dehydration happens when one loses more fluid than they drink. When one’s body doesn’t have enough water, it cannot work properly. Dehydration can range from mild to severe. The signs of dehydration can include:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Dizziness or lightheadedness</li>
			<li>Nausea or vomiting</li>
			<li>Muscle cramps</li>
			<li>Dry mouth</li>
			<li>Sweating stops</li>
			<li>Heart palpitations</li>
