# Fit&FREE

## Description
This is the first software development project I did in a group. 
Fit&Free is the name of the website that I and the other two team members created during my first semester at university. 
The main purpose of the website was to help both people suffering from obesity as well as healthy people to follow a healthy 
diet. My primary job was to write JavaScript and HTML code for the pages that contained BMI and Caloric Need calculators. 
This project significantly contributed to my skills as a team member and also allowed me to experience the real team work.
