# Snake

## Description

This was my first major programming project which I had in college. It was a simple snake game that I built from scratch using Visual Basic Studio. The development of the game involved the use of my problem-solving skills as well as creative thinking.

## Installation

In order to run the game simply download the two files from this project's folder: Snake.exe and Record.txt

[Snake.exe](https://github.com/romanidze2016/Major-projects/blob/master/Snake%20Game/Snake.exe) and [Record.txt](https://github.com/romanidze2016/Major-projects/blob/master/Snake%20Game/Record.txt)
